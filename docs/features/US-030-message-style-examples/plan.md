# Plan

1. Add a dedicated examples view (guarded by a hash route or toggle) so normal sessions remain unchanged.
2. Build four static variants (Ledger Cards, Timeline Stream, Studio Panels, Editorial Notes) with shared sample content.
3. Add navigation controls to switch between variants inside the examples view.
4. Style each variant with distinct layout/typography treatments while avoiding avatars/names.
5. Capture MCP screenshots of each variant and mark stories/notes complete.
