# Plan

1. Locate the permission prompt component and its styles.
2. Adjust layout, padding, border, shadow, and backdrop so it reads as an inline card.
3. Tune typography and button styles to match the subtle reference without losing hierarchy.
4. Verify the permission prompt visually and update story status.
