# Plan

1. Audit current message rendering to find the safest insertion point for markdown parsing.
2. Choose or add a markdown renderer and syntax highlighter that fit existing stack.
3. Render markdown for text blocks and preserve existing tool/diff components.
4. Apply language-aware highlighting for fenced code blocks and tool code diffs.
5. Update styles to align with existing UI polish.
6. Validate via MCP screenshots and mark story items complete.
